       ssyynncc() causes all buffered modifications to file metadata and data to be written to the underlying filesystems.

       ssyynnccffss() is like ssyynncc(), but synchronizes just the filesystem containing file referred to by the open file descriptor _f_d.

       ssyynnccffss() returns 0 on success; on error, it returns -1 and sets _e_r_r_n_o to indicate the error.

       ssyynncc() is always successful.

       ssyynnccffss() can fail for at least the following reason:

       ssyynnccffss() first appeared in Linux 2.6.39; library support was added to glibc in version 2.14.

       ssyynnccffss() is Linux-specific.

       Since glibc 2.2.2, the Linux prototype for ssyynncc() is as listed above, following the various standards.  In glibc 2.2.1 and earlier, it was "int sync(void)", and ssyynncc() always returned 0.

BBUUGGSS
       According to the standard specification (e.g., POSIX.1-2001), ssyynncc() schedules the writes, but may return before the actual writing is done.  However, since version 1.3.20 Linux does actually wait.  (This still does not guarantee data
       integrity: modern disks have large caches.)
